        <p> First up on our list of impressively powerful meals: Belgian Waffles with a kick!
            These waffles, though bitter at first, will no doubt explode with flavor! Just be careful
            washing the plate. We wouldn't want the kitchen being reduced to rubble.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1 &lpar;.25 ounce&rpar; package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup warm milk &lpar;110 degrees F/45 degrees C&rpar;</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 3/4 cups warm milk &lpar;110 degrees F/45 degrees C&rpar;</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>


        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the warm milk and 
                the melted butter. Stir in the yeast mixture, sugar, salt and vanilla. Stir in the 
                remaining 2 1/2 cups milk alternately with the flour, 
                ending with the flour. Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks; 
                fold into the batter. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm 
                place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the waffle iron. Brush with oil and spoon about 1/2 cup 
                &lpar;or as recommended by manufacturer&rpar; onto center of iron. Close the lid and bake until 
                it stops steaming and the waffle is 
                golden brown. Serve immediately with <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Bomu_Bomu_no_Mi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fruit</a>or keep warm in 200 degree oven.</li>
