        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Sponge Cake</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line bottom of two 8-inch cake pans with parchment paper.
                Avoid greasing sides of pan.
            </li>
            <li>Measure and sift dry ingredients, then set aside.</li>
            
            <li>In large bowl of stand mixer or using electric hand mixer, beat the eggs and yolk, sugar, 
                and vanilla on medium-high speed until the triple in size, about 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the flour into the wet 
                ingredients until just combined. Avoid overmixing to maintain a light and fluffy batter 
                and preserve the air bubbles created by whipping the eggs, ensuring an airy cake.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the yogurt and melted butter together.</li>

            <li>Fold this mixture into the batter similarly to how you folded 
                it with the flour. These ingredients will contribute to a moist sponge cake. 
                Divide the batter equally 
                between the two pans and place them in the oven immediately to bake.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the middle 
                comes out clean and the cake is golden brown.

                Once baked, remove the sponge cakes from the oven, 
                place them on a wire rack, and let them cool for 5 minutes. 
                Loosen the sides by inserting a knife between the cake and the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Invert both cake tins onto the cooling rack and remove the 
                parchment paper from the bottom.

                Finally, allow the cakes to cool completely upside down 
                on the wire rack for approximately 2-3 hours. While they cool, you can 
                start preparing the whipped cream.
                
            </li>


        </ol>

        <h3>Whipped Cream</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer with the 
                whipping attachment to beat together the cream and sugar at high speed until 
                stiff peaks form. Cut the fruit into small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Place the first cake layer on a large plate. Add a thin layer of 
                whipped cream on top, arrange half of the fruit, add another thin layer of 
                whipped cream on 
                top of the fruit, and then place the second layer on top.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the remaining whipped cream over the top layer and 
                decorate with the remaining fresh fruit. Serve immediately and store 
                any leftovers in the refrigerator.

            </li>


        </ol>
