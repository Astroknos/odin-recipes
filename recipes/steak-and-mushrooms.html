        <p>Still hungry? Good! Next up in our series is <strong>Steak and Mushrooms</strong>! 
        Fair warning now, these mushrooms aren't ordinary. In fact, they may taste horrid at first,
        but don't fret! These mushrooms will give you strength akin to an ancient deity!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>  
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>6 ounce <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hito_Hito_no_Mi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mushroom</a>slices</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon thyme chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rosemary chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oregano chopped</li>
            <li>2 lean New York Steak strip steaks</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>


        </ul>

        <h3>Garlic Butter Compound</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>1/4 cup softened butter</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon thyme chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rosemary chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oregano chopped</li>


        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>In a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, 
                add olive oil and butter, mushrooms, garlic, thyme, rosemary, and 
                oregano. Cook for about 3 minutes or until tender. 
                Remove and set aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>Turn the skillet to high heat. Add the steaks. Cook on 
                each side for 3 minutes or until outside is browned. Reduce heat 
                to medium-high. Cook the steaks to the desired doneness. Mine took about 10 minutes 
                flipping 3 times to get a medium well.</li>
            <li>Right before the steaks are done, make the 
                garlic butter compound. Mix the butter, garlic and 
                fresh chopped herbs. Slather on top of steaks. Add the mushrooms 
                back to the pan and heat through and let the butter melt into the steaks.
            </li>
            

        </ol>
